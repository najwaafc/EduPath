# EduPath

EduPath is an innovative educational application that integrates talent, community and personal profile recommendation features. Through the recommendation feature, users can explore educational paths that suit their interests and abilities. Community features enable interaction between users, share experiences, and provide support in the educational journey. While the personal profile feature allows users to log their progress, interests and preferences, it allows EduPath to serve more personalized and relevant recommendations over time. EduPath is a partner that helps users find their passion in the world of education while connecting with a supportive community.
